GD Script is optimized for game development, providing powerful tools for creating game logic, handling scenes, and managing user inputs efficiently. As an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, it supports the creation of classes and objects while adhering to key OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Data Formats**: XML(Used for Google AdMob API integration), JSON(Used for game save data management)
- **Tools**: Aseprite, Adobe Photoshop, Audacity.

## Development Process
- **Design**: I created initial game concepts and identified potential design hurdles that could impact player experience. Through extensive research and experimentation, I devised effective coding strategies to overcome these challenges, ensuring a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.

- **Integrate AdMob for Android Version**: I incorporated AdMob to monetize the Android version of the game. This process included setting up ad placements to ensure they did not disrupt gameplay, providing a balanced experience for players while generating revenue. Additionally, I implemented an incentive system where players could choose to watch video ads in exchange for a temporary x2 income boost. This feature not only enhances player engagement but also encourages them to interact with the ads in a way that benefits their gameplay experience.
- **Giving Credits & Writing Store Page Information**: I created a credits section to acknowledge contributors and resources used during development. Additionally, I wrote engaging descriptions and promotional content for the game's Google Play Store page to attract potential players.
